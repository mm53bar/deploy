#Bash based deployment for Rails

I grew tired of configuring Capistrano and yearned for something simpler that I could easily customize. Why not bash?

### Getting Started

Create your own .env file.

     cp .env.sample .env

Update the contents of `.env` with your project details.

### Deploy!

     ./deploy

That's it!
